#  RasGUploader for Stellamove

RasGUploader provides a snappy web interface for uploading 3d printer machine code. It is Free Software
and released under the [GNU Affero General Public License V3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html).

This is basically intended to use OctoPrint's File Manager only, but it will gradually expand its functionality.

## Special Thanks

It was changed using a subset of the Octoprint. OctoPrint's website can be found at [octoprint.org](https://octoprint.org/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme).
